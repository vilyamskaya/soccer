Requirements:

1. Use event delegation to track drag start: a single event handler on document for mousedown.
2. If elements are dragged to top/bottom window edges â€“ the page scrolls up/down to allow further dragging.
3. There is no horizontal scroll (this makes the task a bit simpler, adding it is easy).
4. Draggable elements or their parts should never leave the window, even after swift mouse moves.
